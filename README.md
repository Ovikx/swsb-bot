This bot is for the Star Wars: Space Battle discord server. The bot's goal is to automate niche game-specific tasks.

## Squadron Leaders
Follow these steps to make your squadron official:
1. Ask an admin if you can make your squadron
2. Post your squadron information in the appropriate channel
3. Use the `/assign-role` command to give your squadron's member role to your members (TIP: `/remove-role` removes the role)

## Admins
1. When you approve a squadron, use `/register-squadron` to register the squadron. Make sure you enter the `leader-role` and `member-role` options correctly.
2. If you need to delete a squadron, use `/remove-squadron`. Again, make sure you enter the `/leader-role` option correctly.
